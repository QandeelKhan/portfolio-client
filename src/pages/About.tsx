                            I am a Python and JavaScript developer with having
                            bachelor's in Computer Science (B.S). from GC
                            University Faisalabad and 4 years of software
                            development experience. I am experienced in web
                            development with JavaScript technologies using React
                            JS and React Native and on the back-end side, I'm
                            using python technologies. I have experience with
                            MVT/MVC (Model View Template/Controller) through
                            Django and DRF (Django rest framework) and have been
                            involved in maintaining versions of source code
                            using git version control. <br /> I use a
                            containerized system using Docker/Kubernetes for the
                            portability of my web and mobile projects and
                            deployment. When working on a new project, I like to
                            speak with my clients to understand their needs and
                            version of the project clearly. <br /> Thank you so
                            much for taking the time to review my profile. I
                            look forward to the opportunity of working with you.
                            <br />

On the front-end, I have expertise in JavaScript technologies, including ReactJS and React Native. For the back-end, I leverage Python technologies, particularly Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). I am well-versed in the MVT/MVC (Model View Template/Controller) architectural patterns. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with version control using Git.

I adopt a containerized approach using Docker/Kubernetes to ensure the portability and seamless deployment of my web and mobile projects. When starting a new project, I prioritize effective communication with clients to gain a clear understanding of their requirements and project vision.
